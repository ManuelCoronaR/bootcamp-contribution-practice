# bootcamp-contribution-practice
A repository for the UM Coding Bootcamp Students to practice contributing with GitHub


# Hello Everyone
I got a little bored while practicing and thought of a neat project we could all do together at our own pace & free time.

I've recycled some code I used for my personal website into something we could all work on together and created a GitHub Repo for everyone to access.

With this project we can all practice some super basic HTML and also practice cloning, editing, committing, and finally pushing to GitHub and then submitting a PR request to contribute altogether to a single GitHub repo.

It is extremely straight forward and simple.
All the directions are inside the `index.html` file as `comments`.
Be sure to read them all thoroughly to avoid any unnecessary issues.

Don't worry I tried to make it as simple as copy, paste, & edit.
